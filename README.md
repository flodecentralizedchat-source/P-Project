Welcome to P-Project, a cutting-edge social impact ecosystem built with Rust, WebAssembly, and modern blockchain technologies. What started as a meme coin has evolved into a comprehensive platform for humanitarian aid, social verification, and community-driven governance.

## 🚀 Project Overview

P-Project transforms blockchain technology into a robust, scalable ecosystem with real-world utility. Built with performance and security in mind, our platform offers:

- **Token Contracts** with deflationary mechanisms and automatic rewards
- **DAO Governance** for community-driven decision making
- **Staking System** with time-based yield farming
- **Airdrop Distribution** for early supporters
- **Cross-Chain Bridge** for multi-network compatibility
- **Web Interface** powered by WebAssembly for a seamless user experience
- **AI Integration** for impact verification, NFT art generation, and fraud detection
- **IoT Solutions** for smart donation boxes, refugee camp wristbands, and food distribution systems
- **Web2 Integration** for social media donations, YouTube tips, and messaging platform bots

## 🏗️ Architecture

P-Project follows a modular monorepo architecture using Rust workspaces:

```
